# IMA208---TP2-Motion-Estimation
This second practical work, on motion estimation, deals with parametric motion estimation. You have to reuse some of the functions you implemented during the first practical work.  You are asked to complete the different algorithms and to try it. Also, please answer to the theoretical questions, in the notebook.
